This project was developed as part of [CERES](https://ceresnavigation.org) and aims to provide scientifically useful path tracing capabilities for:
- Rendering photo-real images
- Simulating multi-bounce behavior accounting for wavelength and polarization
- Modeling solar radiation and albedo radiation pressure on spacecraft

## Installation
### Install via pip (RECOMMENDED):
*Coming Soon*

### Build from source (Python setuptools):
```
pip install .
```

### Build from source (CMake on Ubuntu 20.04/18.04):
CRT uses `pybind11` to generate python bindings to the core C++ code.  Because of this, you must have `pybind11` installed on your machine.  We recommend using `pip`:
```
pip install pybind11
```
**NOTE for 18.04 ONLY:** Because `std::filesystem` is not implemented in GNU libstdc++ prior to 9.1 and LLVM libc++ prior to 9.0, you must first upgrade your compiler.  Simply run:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-9 g++-9
export CXX="g++-8" CC="gcc-8"
```

Once `pybind11` is installed, compiling is done via cloning the repository and building using cmake and make:
```
git clone https://github.com/ceres-navigation/ceres-raytracer.git
cd ceres-raytracer
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

*NOTE: the `-j` argument to `make` allows for parallel usage of all available cores for compiling, dramatically speeding up compile times.  If you do not want a parallel compilation, you can simply run `make` with no arguments.*

### Build from source (MacOS 11 and MacOS 10.15):
*Coming Soon*

### Windows:
*Coming Soon*

**NOTE:** Unfortunately, OpenMP is not properly supported by Windows and so parallel tracing is not yet supported in Windows native.  If you wish to compile from source on a Windows machine, we recommend using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

## Using the Python API:
The python API allows for both "static" and "dynamic" scenes.
- **Dynamic:** The BVH is constructed from scratch every time a frame needs to be rendered.  This increases the total rendering time however it allows you to modify each loaded 3d geometry in-between frame renderings.
- **Static:** The BVH is constructed once allowing for faster overall render times.  The downside is that none of the geometries can be modified.

### Dynamic Scene:
The file `demos/cornell_box.py` provides an example of how to setup a dynamic scene. Simply navigate to the `demos/` directory of the cloned `ceres-raytracer` repository, and run: 
```
python cornell_box.py
```
Doing so will produce four images:
- `cornell_box.png`: The rendered image
- `cornell_box_depth.png`: A mask containing the distance to each ray intersection
- `cornell_box_instance.png`: A mask where each color indicates a different object
- `cornell_box_normals.png`: A mask where each pixel is colored by the normal vector of the intersected point

### Static Scene:
The file `demos/bunny.py` provides an example of how to setup a static scene.  Simply navigate to the `demos/` directory of the cloned `ceres-raytracer` repository, and run:
```
python bunny.py
```
Doing so will produce the following image sequence:

This project utilizes a BVH construction and traversal library built by [madmann91](https://github.com/madmann91).  While we have made some modifications to their implementation, their work forms most of the basis of the bounding volume hierarchy used in this project.  Their originally source code can be found in the [bvh repository](https://github.com/madmann91/bvh)


### National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship
This material is based upon work supported by the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) under Grant No. 2020305048.  NSF GRFP gave Chris Gnam the flexibility and resources required to complete his research in spacecraft navigation, and this project is meant to serve as an open source implementation of his dissertation.
